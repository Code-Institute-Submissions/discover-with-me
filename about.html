                <p>The most famous places to visit in Świdnica are:<br>
	            <span> Gothic Cathedral of St. Stanislaus and St. Wenceslaus</span> from the 14th century, which has the highest tower in Silesia, standing around 101 meters tall; <br>
                <span> Evangelical Church of Peace</span>, which is registered on the UNESCO World Culture Heritage List. It was built in one year 1656–57, and is made from wood, clay, sand and straw. No metal nails were used to build it. Everybody assumed this church would survive only around 50 years. Now, more than 350 years later, it still stands tall and is host to the proud society of protestants.<br>
                <span> 16th-century Town Hall</span> has been renovated numerous times and combines Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque architectural elements. It also contains Świdnica's Theatre and The Museum of Old Commerce in Świdnica.<br>

                <p>Within the close area you can see more interesting places. 
                My favorite is <span>Castle Książ</span>. I love this place, it is amazing, historical and beautiful. It’s the largest castle in <span>Lower Silesia</span> and third largest castle in Poland. Each year there is a famous <span>Flower Festival</span> that is extremely popular amongst tourists. It is a great opportunity to visit the castle’s underground, rooms and gardens.<br>
                In <span>Witoszów Dolny</span> you can see <span>The Weapons Museum</span>. Among the items donated by the army and other collectors we can admire tanks, airplanes, several rifles and pistols, as well as other types of guns and white weapons, uniforms, cars and motorcycles.<br> 
                In <span>Mokszeszów</span> there is an old, amazing castle built in 1880-3 by the order of <span>The Maltese Knightswhich</span>. In the years 1938-1945, the castle became a tenement house. At that time, <span>The "Mothers' House"</span> was run for women with pure Aryan blood, who were imported from all over Germany. From 1950s, there was a school in the castle. Now,it is a private property.<br>
                In <span>Jaworzyna Śląska</span> you can visit <span>The Museum of Indrusty and Railway in Silesia</span>.<br>
                I like <span>Zagórze Śląskie</span> as there is a dam on the river, which creates a lake located between mountains with one of the most beautiful views in the area.<span> It also has Castle Grodno</span> located at the top of one of the mountains.<br> 
                <span>Museum Gross-Rossen</span> (a former Nazi Concentration camp) is also a short drive away.<br> 
                Another interesting place to visit is <span>Ślęża Mountain</span> with <span>Tourist House</span>, <span>Observations Tower</span> and <span>Church</span> dedicated to the <span>Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary</span> at the top. This is the highest peak of <span>The Ślęża Massif.</span></p>

# Discover with me
## Swidnica and places near by
[View website in GitHub Pages]()

## Introduction 

I am a student at Code Institute. I want to become a Software Developer. This is my first Milestone Project on this course. 
I come from Poland originally, but I currently live in Ireland. I met a lot of nice and friendly people on the island, and some of them became my friends. We often talk about places that are important to us. Swidnica will always be in my heart, as it is not only my hometown but aslo a very interestig place to visit. My friends often ask about it and other places close by that are worth seeing. These questions inspired me to make this project. 

This site is a work in progress and will be updated with new content. 

Currently this website contains a few pages:
* Home, 
* Gallery,
* About,
* Blog,
* Contact.  

In the future I'll work to update this website with new features, for example: Google Maps, newsletter, etc.

##  User Experience (UX)

Depending on whether they are a new or returning visitor of the website their needs can be a little different. 

### First time users want to:
    * navigate easily throughout the site to find content such as: gallery or recommendations, 
    * get more information about Swidnica and areas nearby,
    * discover new and historical places to visit, as well as, famous people from the area,  
    * be informed about current events, special offers, etc.
    * find social media links,
    * find the best way to contact me with any questions they may have.

### Frequent users come back to:
    * check and read new blog posts,
    * look at new pictures presented in gallery,
    * get trip advise or recommendations,
    * read about new attractions or special events,
    * sign up to the frequently updated newsletter,

## Features

### Global

This website has a responsive navigation bar located at the top of the page. This feature is also available on each subpage. On the right side of the navbar are links to other subpages such as Home, About, Gallery, Blog and Contact.  On the left side is a logo, which I created on Notepad. 
The website also has the same style footer stuck at the bottom of each page with links to social media, which open in separate pages. The footer also contains copyright information. 

### Local

#### Home page 
This page contains jumbotron with a picture and a welcome paragraph. There is a call to action button which when clicked, moves visitors to the Gallery.

#### About 
This is a page where you can read a little more about Świdnica. It contains information about monuments and places to see in Świdnica and its close region. There are also some facts about famous people that were born and raised in the city and the area. There is also a section about regular events that take place in the city.

#### Gallery
This page shows sample photos. Gallery on mobile devices shows one photo under the other, whereas larger screens, like laptops, show photos in three columns. When a website user clicks a picture, they will open a new page called Blog. There is also a call to action button to Write to Me. 

#### Blog
This site currently asks the website users to send in the topics they would be interested in reading about. In the future, this site would be a host to the various blog posts about the topics chosen by the site visitors. This page also contains two buttons, one to view the Gallery and the other to Write to Me.

#### Contact 
This page has a form to fill, and call to action buttons which move visitors to the Gallery or Blog page.

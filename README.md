# Discover with me
## Swidnica and Lower Silesia
[View website in GitHub Pages]()

This website is created to promote my home town in Poland. My dream is to create a place, where people could find essential information about attractions in the town and near by. Swidnica and all of Lower Silesia region has a lot to offer. I'll gladly share my favourite places with you. 

For the purpose, of my Full Stack Developer Course in Code Institute I decided to only create the pages listed below:

* Home, 
* News,
* Gallery,
* Go & See, 
* About, 
* Contact.  

In the future I'll work to update this website with new features.

[View website in GitHub Pages]()

## Introduction 

I am a student at Code Institute. I want to become a Software Developer. This is my first Milestone Project on this course. 
Originally I come from Poland, but I currently live in Ireland. I met here a lot of nice and friendly people, and some of them became my friends. When often talked about places that are important to us. Swidnica will always be in my heart. It is a very interestig place to visit. My friends often ask about it and other places close by that are worth seeing. These questions inspired me to make this project. 

This site is a work in progress and will be updated with new content. 

Currently this website contains a few pages:
* Home, 
* Gallery,
* About,
* Blog,
* Contact.  

In the future I'll work to update this website with new features, for example: Google Maps, newsletter, etc.

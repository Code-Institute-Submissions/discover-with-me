            <h3 class="hero-image-text">Around the city</h3>

            <p>In close area you can see more interesting places. 
            My favorite is <span>Castle Książ</span>. I love this place, it is amazing, historical and beautiful. It’s the largest castle in <span>Lower Silesia</span> and third largest castle in Poland. Each year there is a famous <span>Flower Festival</span> that is extremely popular amongst tourists. It is a great opportunity to visit the castle’s underground, rooms and gardens.</br>
            Close by in <span>Ciernie</span> you can see large ruins of <span>Widow’s Palace</span>, which hold a very sad, romantic story.</br>
            •	In <span>Witoszów Dolny</span> you can see <span>The Weapons Museum</span>. Among the items donated by the army and other collectors we can admire tanks, airplanes, several rifles and pistols as well as other types of guns and white weapons, uniforms and cars and motorcycles. 
            •	In <span>Mokszeszów</span> there is an old, amazing castle built in 1880-3 by the order of <span>The Maltese Knightswhich</span>. In the years 1938-1945, the castle became a tenement house. At that time, <span>The "Mothers' House"</span> was run (for women with pure Aryan blood), which were imported from all over Germany. From the 1950s, there was a school in the castle. Now, it is a private property.
            •	In <span>Jaworzyna Śląska</span> you can see <span>The Museum of Indrusty and Railway in Silesia</span>.
            •	I like <span>Zagórze Śląskie</span> there is a dam on the river, which creates a lake located between mountains with one of the most beautiful views in my area. <span>Castle Grodno</span>, which is located on the top of one of the mountains. 
            •	<span>Museum Gross-Rossen</span> (of the former Nazi Concentration camp) is also a short drive away. 
            •	Very interesting place to visit is <span>Ślęża Mountain</span> with <span>Tourist House, <span>Observations Tower</span> and <span>Church</span> dedicated to the <span>Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary</span> on the top. This is the highest the peak of the <span>Ślęża Massif</span>.</p>
